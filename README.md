SID module control
==================

reSID is pretty good, but wasn't quite good enough...

This tool interpretes sid-files and sends the SID register values to
[seb's awesome SID module](https://github.com/sebseb7/SidModule).

The MOS 6502 emulation code is not mine. I found it
[here](http://svn.dslinux.org/viewvc/dslinux/branches/vendor/tinysid/sidengine.c?view=markup).
May the author not get mad at me.
